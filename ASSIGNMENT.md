# FRAME Assignment Instructions

## Decentralized Exchange

- Use a multi-asset pallet to represent many tokens.
  - You may create your own or use the included `pallet_assets`.
- Create a Uniswap Version 2 style DEX to allow users to trustlessly exchange tokens with one another.
  - Implement rewards to incentivize users to create pools.
  - Expose an API from the pallet which acts as a “price oracle” based on the existing liquidity pools.

### _Optional_

- Create some kind of asset or marketplace where users can use any token to purchase resources, using the price oracle to make sure users pay enough.
- Integrate other DeFi utilities on top of your DEX.
